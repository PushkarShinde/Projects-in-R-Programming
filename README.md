I got the idea for this project from an article on Medium, titled [R Programming ..Beginner Project 2](https://medium.com/@satishmishra91/r-programming-beginner-project-2-55d9b6fa8da9).
However there are some errors in the code provided by the admin of the article and also the instructions are not beginner friendly, hence you can refer to the code file provided by me in the repository. Best Regards!
