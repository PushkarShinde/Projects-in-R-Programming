## Project 1: Heart Weight Prediction Model using R

### Description: 
In this project, I developed a prediction model to estimate the heart weight of cats using the Cats dataset available in the `MASS` package of CRAN. The goal was to predict the heart weight based on various features available in the dataset. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training, I achieved a correlation of approximately 80% between the variables. Additionally, the prediction model achieved an accuracy of around 70%, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating cat heart weights based on the provided features such as Body weight and Sex metrics.

Results:
- **Correlation**: ~80% between the variables.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: ~70%.

Dataset: The Cats dataset used in this project is available in the `MASS` package of CRAN. For more information about the dataset, refer to the [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/MASS.pdf).

## License

I got the idea for Project 1 from an article on Medium, titled [R Programming ..Beginner Project 2](https://medium.com/@satishmishra91/r-programming-beginner-project-2-55d9b6fa8da9).
However there are some errors in the code provided by the admin of the article and also the instructions are not beginner friendly, hence you can refer to the code file provided by me in the repository. Best Regards!
